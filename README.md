# SweepBot-Automated-Floor-Cleaner-Robot-Project-
SweepBot is a low-cost student robot that navigates to a target, wets the floor with a DC pump, and mops using an L298N-driven motor. An ultrasonic interlock adds safety, and an optional SG90 servo lifts the mop. A simple, tunable state machine controls wetting, mopping, and shutdown for adaptable, reliable cleaning.
